This is an Server Pack created by Sayanikukitsune ("Sayaniku la renarde" on discord).
The default skyblock world is automatically generated, for creating an new skyblock island, you need to make "/skyblock create [Optional name island]"
The default claiming chunk and loading chunk is 500 and 25
Before this version (the 0.9.5.1), the server pack isn't possible due at an tag problem, thx to velvet, sayaniku and mycraft to find the problem, whithout them, this server pack wasn't possible
